# Modelling Circular Inference in Bipolar Disorder

My very first attempt at implementing the experiment and model from Simonsen et al. (2021) for mood disorders. It was largely incorrect as the implementation in the paper confused me slightly, and did not show explicitly how it was implemented in the code. So the implementation in here is wrong. The data from the experiment might still be useful.
